  abstract = "Conjugating antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to nonlinear polymers
              is a promising strategy to overcome the translational challenges
              of AMPs toward treating infections caused by antibiotic-resistant
              bacteria. Nonlinear polymers, and therefore conjugates, can be
              prepared with various architectures (e.g., star-shaped,
              comb-like, hyperbranched, etc.), however, the effects of polymer
              architecture on antimicrobial performance and related properties,
              like size and morphology in solution and secondary structure, are
              not yet well-understood. Here, we compare conjugates of the human
              chemokine-derived AMP stapled P9 with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
              prepared in two of the major nonlinear architectures: star-shaped
              and comb-like. At comparable molecular weights and compositions
              (peptide wt \%), comb-like conjugates afford increased helicity,
              solubility, antimicrobial activity, and proteolytic stability
              compared to star-shaped analogs. We then leveraged the expansive
              design space of comb-like architectures to prepare conjugates
              with different backbone lengths and PEG side chain lengths, with
              shorter PEG side chains leading to increased helicity, yet
              potentially less shielding from proteolytic degradation and the
              longest backbone lengths furnishing the most potent antimicrobial
              activity. Both comb-like and star-shaped conjugates display high
              zeta potential, indicating that the cationic AMPs were accessible
              for electrostatic interactions with bacterial membranes. Yet, the
              comb-like conjugates showed a higher fraction of unimolecular
              structures indicative of a lower propensity for supramolecular
              assembly that could be encumbering the desired AMP-bacteria
              interactions in the star-shaped conjugates. Together, our work
              shows comb-like AMP-polymer conjugates to outperform analogous
              star-shaped conjugates, while adding design flexibility to access
              an expansive range of monomer chemistries, monomer distributions,
              and backbone lengths to modulate performance-determining
              properties and ultimately furnish an effective suite of
              AMP-polymer materials as alternatives to conventional antibiotics
              for combatting bacterial infections.",
